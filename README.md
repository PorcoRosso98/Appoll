"Appoll" is a simple application aimed at enabling global sharing of one's preferences. In Appoll, every user will have the opportunity to create rankings on any topic to know what the world thinks and publish them online. Other users will have the ability to interact with the rankings by upvoting and downvoting the items within the rankings.


Roadmap:
  - Implementation of the HomeScreen where users can view a list of already created rankings.
  - Implementation of the PollScreen where users get redirected after selecting a ranking.
  - Implementation of backend security using Spring Boot in a new project named AppollBe.
  - Implementation of the first REST APIs using Spring Boot.
